1.加载时机
If you add a svg into your html it is loaded immediately when the DOM is parsed.【inline svg】

If you load your icons by font, you might have a small timeframe when the page loads, where icons aren't shown because a font loads when it's first used, not on page load.


2.可定制化程度
With SVG you can change colors of shapes and paths. SVG is just text and better compressed.

Fonts you can only change colors of the whole icon.


3.动画
Svgs can be animated.
